# CalMaestro

AM, using ical.NET, does not provide a good implementation of iCal.

To fix this, it is proposed to create a custom interpreter to deserialise the webcals feed, correct the issues and republish the new feed externally.

Python to be used inititally for rapid prototyping. But could be implemented for production using Flask.

Otherwise, the backend will be eventually developed as a microservice/headless in Javascript.
